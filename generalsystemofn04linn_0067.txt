Inhabits the vast mat-shy plains of Bothn'ia an'd Fiala11d 3 where
it crawls up {hruns and sedgegrass, and being carried rn-
wards by the wind, pentrates suddenly into such expn‘ed
parts of men and horse- as are not perpendicularly fitu'xted.
It quiekly buries itself under the skin, leaving a black point
where it had entered, whtch is Γ)οη succeeded by the most
'excruciating pains, inflammation and gangrene of the part,
swooning and death. This all happens in the course of a day
or two, frequently within a few houm, umes< the animal be
immediately extracteo, which is effestcd with great ctzution
and difficulty, by applying a poultice of curds or emese} or
carefully diffeffing between th'e muscles where it had entered.
