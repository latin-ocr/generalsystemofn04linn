Are compofite animia holding a medinm
between animals and vegetables- Most of
{lem take root and grow up into stems;
multiplying life in their branches and de·-
ciduous buds, andin the transformation of
their animated bloffoms or polypes which ¹
are endowed with spontaneous motion.
Plants therefore resemble Zoophytes, but
are destitute of animation and th'e power of
locornotion: and Zoophytes are as it were
plants, but furnished with sensation and
the organs of spontaneous motion. Ofthese
some are. soft and naked, and are called
Zoophytes; others are covered with a hard
ss1cll, and are denominated Lithophytea.

tute of tentacula orjeciers, and generally
not vlfible to the naked eye. They are
mossly found in infusmns of various vegeta-
ble substanccs3 and after becomlngdry, do
